# Lem

**Your local AI infrastructure, securely accessible from anywhere.**

Lem is an open-source platform for managing and remotely accessing your local AI services (Ollama, Open WebUI, and more) through secure peer-to-peer connections.

## 🌟 Features

- **🚀 One-Click Setup**: Install and manage Ollama + Open WebUI with a single command
- **🔒 Secure Remote Access**: Access your local AI from anywhere using WebRTC P2P or encrypted relay
- **🏠 Privacy-First**: Your data stays local. Remote access requires your explicit authentication
- **🐳 Docker-Based**: Clean, isolated environments for each service
- **🌐 Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2)
- **📱 Web Dashboard**: Beautiful, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Access your home AI setup from work or travel
- Share your local models with trusted collaborators (coming in v1.0)
- Centralize AI infrastructure without cloud vendor lock-in
- Self-host everything with full control

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and Docker Compose
- **Python 3.11+** (recommended: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+** and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lem-app/lem.git
cd lem

# Start the local server
cd lem-app/server
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5142

# In another terminal, start the web dashboard
cd lem/lem-app/web/local
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Lem consists of five main components:

1. **Local Server** (`/server`): FastAPI server running on your machine (port 5142)
2. **Local Dashboard** (`/web/local`): React web UI for managing local services
3. **Remote Dashboard** (`/web/remote`): React web app for accessing your local AI remotely
4. **Cloud Signaling** (`/cloud/signaling`): WebRTC signaling for P2P connections
5. **Cloud Relay** (`/cloud/relay`): Fallback relay for restricted networks


## 🔐 Security

- **P2P by default**: Direct WebRTC connections when possible
- **End-to-end encryption**: All remote traffic is encrypted
- **JWT authentication**: Secure access to cloud services
- **Device registration**: ed25519 public key authentication
- **Open source**: Full transparency, audit the code yourself

## 📜 License

Lem is open source software licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)**.

### What this means for you:

✅ **You can:**
- Run Lem locally for personal or commercial use
- Modify the code for your own needs
- Self-host all components (local server + cloud services)
- Fork and experiment with the code
- Audit the source code for security

✅ **If you run Lem's cloud services publicly**, you must:
- Open source any modifications you make
- Use the same AGPL-3.0-or-later license
- Provide source code to your users

### Why AGPL?

We chose AGPL to keep Lem truly open source while ensuring that improvements benefit the entire community. If someone offers Lem as a hosted service, they must share their code—preventing proprietary forks.
